          <p class="resume-content">
            My name is Charlie, and I'm a software engineer with a
            passion for surfing, music, and programming. I grew up
            near the beach, and I've been surfing for over 10 years,
            which has given me a deep appreciation for the ocean and
            the outdoors. Music is another one of my passions, and
            I've been playing guitar, bass, and drums for several
            years. I love playing with other musicians and performing
            live in front of an audience. Programming is also a
            significant interest of mine. I discovered my talent for
            it during college, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in
            Computer Science. Since then, I've honed my skills in
            various programming languages and development tools, and I
            currently work for a tech startup that creates software
            for managing and analyzing large amounts of data. When I'm
            not working, surfing, or playing music, I love
            experimenting with new programming languages and tools,
            and working on side projects that challenge me creatively.
            Overall, I'm a driven and creative person who values a
            well-rounded and fulfilling life.
